# TAKEAWAY FROM THE LAB

in this Lab we can refresh our skills:<br><br>

- virtualization skills, installing VMâ€™s.
 
- Windows Domain Controller.
- Creating an Active Directory.
- joining a windows 10 machine to the Domain.
- Creating organizational Units.
- Creating users in the Organizational units.
- Installing Sysmon in windows.<br><br>

We can Learn Something New:<br><br>

- Creating a Splunk Server.
- Installing and configuring Splunk Forwarders in windows.
- Creating Indexes in Splunk Server.
- Monitoring the events in Splunk event search.
- Install Atomicred Team.
- Run Atomicred Team Tests using MITRE ATT&CK framework
- Use of PowerShell to run tests.<br><br>

     The purpose is to learn how to monitor events in windows machines using Splunk.
Splunk uses Forwarding agents which forward the logs and events to the Splunk Server.
Sysmon has to be installed into windows and is used to collect windows events and logs.
We can Create various Alerts and Dashboards in Splunk and Monitor these Events.
